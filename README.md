### Track your workouts one sprint at a time!

*Keeping fit by running or walking is popular amongst millions of people across the entire globe from your local park to the olympic games.* 
*An essential part of increasing an individuals fitness and the ability to objectively gauge their own fitness is logging activity times, intensity, heart-rate and factors such as surface& weather.* *Sprint aims to allow individual of all ages, gender and abilities, to enter their activity and input different variables of set activity such as distance, time and activity difficulty.*

## UX

__Sprint__ site was inspired by an app I use everyday named, __Strava__ see their website here:
https://www.strava.com/.

__Sprint__ website offers a user **(see user stories below)** a visually impactful experience through its application of..

* A primary design goal of this website is to be easy for athletes to log their activity data.

* The site should be appealing to view, using imagery and 

* Input forms to be intuitive, if user has previously entered the same information, for example Name, the text box should provide a clickable drop option for user name to click the box rather than type out his/her name.

## Version Control
This sites version control is through github and using gitpod IDE, once completed a piece of work, I would type into the terminal:
  
#### git add index.html
 - *Adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.*
  
#### git commit -m "Update index.html code formatting" 
 - *Captures the state of a project at that point in time. Ensure message is specific to the changes made to the file(s).*
 
#### git push index.html
 - *This pushes the file to the github project repository.*

## Deployment
* This site is hosted on Heroku

* .....

* .....

* To run locally, you can visit the project page(master branch):

  <details>
  <summary>Master Branch page</summary>
  <br>
  <div align="center">
    <img src="" target="_blank" rel=""/>
  </div>
 </details>

* To run this site locally, via git-pod, type into the terminal:
  
  - python3 -m http.server 
  
  - opens port 8000, which the IDE presents three options two of which, view the site immediately:
  __Open preview(Opens a window within the IDE) or open in browser(that is set as the main browser).__

* The code will be executed in the browser that is set as main browser, this can be Chrome or one of the other available browsers. 
When executed the homepage will appear.
