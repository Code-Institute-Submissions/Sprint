## Project purpose

The purpose of this project is to be used as a personal activity log for my runs; because I am passionate about running and want to keep a daily log of set activities to track my times, distance& activity difficulty. 


## UX

__Sprint__ site was inspired by an app I use everyday named, __Strava__ see their website here:
https://www.strava.com/.

__Sprint__ website aims: **(Also see user stories below and project purpose above)**.

* To be easy to log activities.

* The site should be appealing to view, using imagery and bright colors.

* Input forms to be intuitive, if user has previously entered the same information, those details will already be filled in for example: name, last name, gender and postcode.

## Version Control
This sites version control is through github and using gitpod IDE, once completed a piece of work, I would type into the terminal:
  
#### git add index.html
 - *Adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.*
  
#### git commit -m "Update index.html code formatting" 
 - *Captures the state of a project at that point in time. Ensure message is specific to the changes made to the file(s).*
 
#### git push index.html
 - *This pushes the file to the github project repository.*

## Deployment
* This site is hosted on Heroku

* .....

* .....

* To run locally, you can visit the project page(master branch):

  <details>
  <summary>Master Branch page</summary>
  <br>
  <div align="center">
    <img src="" target="_blank" rel=""/>
  </div>
 </details>

* To run this site locally, via git-pod, type into the terminal:
  
  - python3 -m http.server 
  
  - opens port 8000, which the IDE presents three options two of which, view the site immediately:
  __Open preview(Opens a window within the IDE) or open in browser(that is set as the main browser).__

* The code will be executed in the browser that is set as main browser, this can be Chrome or one of the other available browsers. 
When executed the homepage will appear.
